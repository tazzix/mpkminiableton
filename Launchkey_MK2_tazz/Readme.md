# Novation LaunchKey 25 MK2 (Customized)

- Changed Pot modes: Device, Volume, Pan, SendA-D (trying to add pad mode change here)
- 7 instead of 8 channels
- Last two pads: Top-Metronome, Bottom-makes bottom pad row to become mute toggles

## Wish List

- Pad mode changes like Pot modes
- Cycle like MK3, needs moving from _Framework to ableton.v2
